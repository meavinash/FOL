  # ---- TYPES FOR TERMS AND FORMULAS ----

  # fol_type represents possible types in your logic system.
  # - :i means "individual" (like a person, object, etc.)
  # - :o means "truth value" (true/false)
  # - {:arrow, a, b} means "function from a to b" (used for predicates/functions of any arity)
  @type fol_type ::
          :i
          | :o
          | {:arrow, fol_type(), fol_type()}

  # tableau might work with.
  @type fol_term ::
          # Variable (e.g., {:var, :x, :i} for individual variable x)
          {:var, atom(), fol_type()}

          # Application (e.g., applying function f to x: {:app, f, x})
          | {:app, fol_term(), fol_term()}

          # Constant (predicate, function, or named object)
          | {:const, atom(), fol_type()}

          # Explicit equality (rarely used directlyâ€”usually "=" is a constant)

          | {:not, fol_term()}                         # Negation
          | {:and, fol_term(), fol_term()}             # Conjunction
          | {:or, fol_term(), fol_term()}              # Disjunction
          | {:imp, fol_term(), fol_term()}             # Implication
